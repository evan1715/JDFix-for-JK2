cm_motd "^2Bug reports? ^5Report to: jedidog.freeforums.org\n^2Newest things that are fixed:\n^5New Anti Name Crash\n^5Knockdown push/pull bug\n^5Saber throw in duel is now enabled again\n^5Backwards roll speed\n^5Push/Pull knockdown time\n"

1.03 update that need to be converted to 1.02:
* Corrected an exploit that allowed players to have force
powers outside of what the server rules allow.
* Backflip now requires that you double tap the jump button.
* Lightsaber usage in multiplayer has been modified to work
similarly to the way it works in single player levels. This
will enable better saber battles up close with your opponent.
* Lightsabers will do less damage at the very start and very
end of a swing. This should prevent kills from just touching
an opponent with the tip of your lightsaber.
* Force Heal and Force Drain have been adjusted to require more
force energy to use them.
