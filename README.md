# JK2-JKA-Code
I used to work on a few mods for the video games Jedi Knight 2 and Jedi Knight Academy. These folders and files are what I worked on from ~2007-2009 in the C language. The goal of the mod, JDFix, was to fix, work-around, supplement, and more to counter bugs, crashes, expand limited features, and others too.


## JDFix Mod
This is my mod for Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast. The game had a lot of bugs, so the goal of it was to fix many of them.

### JDFix 1.04 Mod
Under the folder JediDog Fix is where the "release" styled stuff is with the compiled file needed, a readme, version history, and a folder containing the only code files that were modified. There's a lot to it, so go ahead and read the .txt files for details. The folder 1.04 fix/Code is where all source code is for the folder needed to compile.

### JDFix 1.03 Mod
The only source code available for modding was to JK2 1.04, so in order to use a mod in a previous version, the gameplay and many other things had to change, be balanced, and more for it to be working. I did quite a bit to make it work mostly on 1.03. It included all of JDFix. Not everything was adjusted to 1.03 gameplay. See the JDClanMod for 1.03 below.


## Clan Mod Folder

### cm_v2.04
This was a mod called Clan Mod by someone else for JK2 v1.04. I integrated my anti-cheat, work-arounds, anti-crashes, etc because the owner of CM asked me for it. The changelog.txt will show some details.

### JDClanMod
This was me taking the Clan Mod plus JDFix integrated in it from JK2 1.04 and backporting it to JK2 1.03. The changelog.txt shows more details.
