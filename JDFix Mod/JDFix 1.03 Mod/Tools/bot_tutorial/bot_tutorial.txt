Title:			Bot creation tutorial

---------------------------------------------
Included with this tutorial are two files, example.bot and example.jkb.
example.bot defines our bot for the game menus. example.jkb is referenced
by the entry in example.bot, so that once we add our example bot in the
game he will use the personality and properties in that jkb file. A ".bot"
file can be named anything, though it's probably preferrable to name it
the same as the jkb file. All bot files should go in the base/scripts
folder, and all jkb files should go in the base/botfiles folder.

In the example.bot file included, there is a sample entry for the "Example"
bot. It contains entries for name, model, color, and which personality file
to use. Personality files are merely .jkb files, so our example bot entry
points to the included example.jkb file. Open the .bot file up in notepad
and take a look at it, each entry is commented and explained there.

In the .jkb file, the bot's actual behavioral properties and chat settings
are defined. I have commented the included jkb file heavily so it shouldn't
be hard to figure out what each setting does. You can open .jkb files in
any plain text editor such as notepad to edit them, as with .bot files.
